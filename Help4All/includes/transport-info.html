<p>We provide airport pickup/drop and ride share services at affordable prices. Choose from many of our service providers. They will pick you up from your pre-confirmed location and drop you off at your destination.<br>To confirm your booking, you just need to pay the base charge of your trip upfront.</p>
<p><i>Note: 
    <ul>
        <li>The base charge covers your trip cost if the distance travelled is 15 KMs or less. After 15 KMs, additional <strong>$1.50</strong> will be added.</li>
        <li>If you need to change your pickup location, time or the destination, you can only do that once by contacting us through our helpline atleast 8 hours before the confirmed pickup time. <u>No changes will be allowed after that.</u><br>
        Cancellations:
            <ul>
                <li>If you cancel before 8 hours of your confirmed pickup time, then you will be eligible for a full refund of the base charge.</li>
                <li>If you cancel before 5 hours of your confirmed pickup time, you will be refunded only 50% of the base charge.</li>
                <li><u>No refund will be given in any other case.</u></li>
            </ul></li></ul>
